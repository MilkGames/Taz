Taz uses packfiles (.ps2/.xbx/.gbc/.pc) to store all the resources used in the game.
These packfiles are created using the packager tool within gizmo.

To build a packfile you should follow these steps:

1) Run gizmo from the c:\babel\gizmo\gizmo.exe.

2) From the gizmo\tools menu choose packager.

3) Choose file\open profile to select a profile from the c:\taz\profiles directory.

4) From the profile drop box you can now select the specific profile you wish to build.

5) Next choose build from the profile menu.

6) In the new dialog box make sure the xbx box is ticked in the top left box.

7) Now click the build button and the package should be built.
	All packages will be built into the c:\taz\paks directory with the exception of splshscr.xbx, streams.xbx
	and text.xbx which will be in the c:\taz\source directory.
