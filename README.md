# Taz: Wanted Source Code
Check Building.txt for basic information about building the game.

Check Packfiles.txt and Gizmo folder to build your own archives for the game.

# Additional information:
Taz was written in Visual Studio 6, redist C++ is still unknown and will be specified later.

Gizmo is not optimized for Windows 7+ systems. Use Windows 98/Windows 2000 compatibility mode or run it on a virtual machine.

This repository doesn't include game packages, you need to have them from your game CD or download the original DVD with the game source code [here](https://archive.org/details/redump-id-123502).
